            <h2>The Waste Management and Recycling Automation project is designed to address the growing challenges of waste disposal and recycling. It features four key modules: Waste Generation Monitoring, which tracks and logs waste production in real-time; Route Optimization, which ensures efficient planning for collection vehicles to minimize fuel usage and operational costs; Waste Classification, where waste is segregated into specific types for recycling or disposal; and Selling Recycled Products, focusing on marketing and selling recycled materials and eco-friendly products to promote a circular economy. This system aims to enhance sustainability, reduce environmental impact, and optimize waste management processes.</p>

### Hello, I'm [Srujan Kapale]üëã

I am passionate about technology and problem-solving. Here's a glimpse of my work:

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects
- **Project 1**: A Waste Management and Recycling Automation System include 4 modules:**Waste generation monitoring**(monitors waste generation), **Route optimization**(planning and executing the  most efficient routes for waste collection vehicle), **Waste Classification**(segregate all the waste and send it to particular industry), and **Selling Recycled Products**(Sell the recycled products). The Waste Management and Recycling Automation system streamlines waste handling through efficient monitoring, classification, and collection routes. It also promotes sustainability by recycling materials and selling eco-friendly products.
